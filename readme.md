# Developing personal website

In preparation for developing my personal website, I reviewed several key concepts that we had covered in the courses. Once I felt confident in my understanding, I began the next phase of the project by using HTML to organize all of the information I wanted to include on the site. And while creating my own website, I also gain new knowledge as I experiment with the codes to meet the idea that I want to pull off.
